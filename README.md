Set up a testing infrastructure with Mocha, Chai, and Karma...
Install (and track) any dependencies
Set up a Karma test runner configuration file
Write a test in a spec file in the test/ directory
Ensure that you can run at least one test before moving forward (This could just confirm that 1+1 is 2 - just a sanity check.)
Write tests for the two functions in the window.calc namespace...
The description of the functions are in the source code, read them!
Ensure that you are testing not just the success conditions, but also the failures!
For example, ensure that a function acts as expected both with good arguments and bad arguments!
Fix any broken code based on your expectations
